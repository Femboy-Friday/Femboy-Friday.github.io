    <h2>College Experience</h2>
    <p>This page will be about my time in college and what I am doing, this tool will be helpful
        as it will help me become better with web develpoment and will get me to review what I go over in college,
        so what have I done so far well I have been to my induction which has got me to learn a lot about my class 
        as it has let me see whos in my class and also let me know what will be happening throughout the year.

    <h2>04/10/23 UPDATE</h2>
    <p>This is an update of the course so far and bout how its going so leets get into it, so far the course has been interesting as I 
      have came to relise that I am ahead of the curve when it comes to some of the things for example the OSI model as I have already been learning it 
      through try hack me. We did a test last week and I had completed it within 5 minutes which is either a good thing or a bad thing but only time will tell 
      we have a discord server going just now however I have not spoke much in it due to me not knowing many people in it however I am still talking to the same group of 
      people and stopped playing sports at luch as I started going with Sam.
