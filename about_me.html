    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Mckenzie Gillespie, a 17-year-old student. I'm into cyber security and software engineering,
       and I like dabbling in a few other things for fun. I also work in a phone shop as a sales assistant,
        which helps me learn about economics through interactions with people managing their money.
         I enjoy playing video games that involve deep understanding of in-game mechanics; it's a bit silly, but it's a fun way for me to spend my time.
          Minecraft is a big favorite of mine, and I also like playing No Man's Sky. If you're interested in checking out photos and videos, you can find them on the images page.

    <p>REcently I attended my college induction where I learned what we would be doing for the year and I learned who was in my class which has lots of people from last year which is good as it means 
      I wont have to get to know many new people.</p>
